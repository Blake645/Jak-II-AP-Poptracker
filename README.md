# Jak-II-AP-Poptracker
This is a pop tracker for Jak II Archipelago, Now while it's still in an unstable state. I was able to get a good idea on what is gonna set when it comes out fully to the public.
This has all the items on the left side that turns on when collected.
All missions appear on the Haven City Map and also the stage map.

"What about the orbs?"
Those are gonna be added when the Archipelago will have them randomized, as of right now the people who are making it are trying to find a way to make them count as checks. but once that's done. this will get an update to have orbs appear in each map.
Hope you guys enjoy!
